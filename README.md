ML_project with Prof.Stefan Ringe(https://ringelab.com/)

The purpose of this code is 
to facilitate a project that aims to compute the internal energy of molecules, 
obtained from the ab initio method (CCSD(T)), 
more quickly and efficiently using various approaches with GAP and QUIP

Internal - Using energy contribution from each Internal coordinate

Normal+harmonic - Using energy contribution from each Normal coordinate / Hessian matrix

Script - helps to generate and run the scripts for SLURM system

Other codes - other codes... mostly for analyzing and proto-type
